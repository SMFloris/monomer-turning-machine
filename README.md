# Monomer Turning Machine in C3 + Raylib

![printscreen](resources/monomer.png?raw=true "Monomer Turning Machine")

Based on the paper `Turning Machines: a simple algorithmic model` by: W. Lui and Ashutosh Saxena.

The program randomly generates monomer chains. Blocking rule is partially modified from the one in the paper.
